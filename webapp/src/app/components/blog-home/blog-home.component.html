    <p class="card-text">Hi, my Name is Felix. With this blog I want to share some of my DIY-projects, snippets I find worthy of mentioning and not common issues I faced.</p>
    <p class="card-text">This blog is programmed in <i class="fab fa-angular"></i>ngular without any database attached to it. Why, I liked the idea of not having a database
      involved like it is with JEKYLL. If you want to find out more about this, follow my blog-post to this topic.</p>

      <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        All information, code-snippets and solutions come "as is" with no warrenty.
